            <p>The IV curve of a solar cell is the superposition of the IV curve of the solar cell
                diode in the dark with the light-generated current.1 The light has the effect of shifting
                the IV curve down into the fourth quadrant where power can be extracted from the diode.
                Illuminating a cell adds to the normal "dark" currents in the diode so that the diode law becomes.
